            <h2 class = "UMUC">University of Maryland University College</h2>
            <p class = "UMUC">My first academic environment I enrolled in, now called University of Maryland Global Campus. I was a couple years into the navy and had plenty of free time while working my Panama shift. I started on a Computer Science program, which I failed
                out of within several weeks due to programming and math being very hard. I changed to Computer Networks and Systems later, but never finished.

            <h2 class = "TCC">Tidewater Community College</h2>
            <p class = "TCC">After putting a stop to my academic plans, I spent a couple years on a ship where I did a deployment and several underways. The ship went into the shipyards and that gave 
                another opportunity to continue my degree. I started as an Engineering major with the hopes or becoming an electrical engineer or computer engineer. I spent two years working on 
                the numerous math classes working my way through nearly all of them along with the science classes. But I got burnt out and chose not to finish. Plus my ship was getting out of the shipyards and
                I would be gone on several more underways.

            <h2>Northern Virginia Community College</h2>
            <p>Towards the final years in my time in the navy, I told myself that I would at least get an Associates in something. I had switched majors too many times and I didn't even have a piece
                of paper to show for anything. I enrolled and completed two semesters worth of classes to get my Associates in General Studies from Northern Virginia Community College around the time I separated from 
                active duty. Total costs: $0.

            <h2>George Mason University</h2>
            <p>After graduating from NOVA, I enrolled into George Mason University's Information Technology program where I am today. I am currently working towards finishing the program and then starting their
                Software Engineering Masters program. The goal is to actually finish and preferably by the end of the decade.
